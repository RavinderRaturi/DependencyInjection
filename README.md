Tutorial Video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtDTfn8YxXg&t=113s

I was going through a tutorial Video on Microsoft channel where they were talking about DI. I checked if they have provided any code where I can play with but unfortunately I could not find anything on the description. There were multiple people in the comment section looking for code base for the problem they solved in the video. 

I decided to re-write what the instructors were doing in the video for the benefit of learning.
